# Patient Management System
This is a full-stack application for managing patient records. It includes a backend API (Java/Spring Boot), a frontend user interface (React), and a database (PostgreSQL) with a graphical user interface (Adminer), all running together in Docker.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, you need to have the following installed on your computer:

Docker

Docker Compose

No other software (like Java, Node.js, or PostgreSQL) is needed on your machine. Everything runs inside Docker containers.

## One-Command Setup
Follow these simple steps to get the entire application up and running.

1. Open a Terminal
Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the Project Folder
Go into the patient-management-system folder where this README.md file is located.

3. Run the Command
Execute the following command. This will build the container images for the frontend and backend, and then start all the services. The first time you run this, it will take a few minutes.

docker-compose up --build

## How to Access the Application
Once the command finishes and the logs are running, you can access the different parts of the system:

1. Main User Interface

Open your web browser and go to: http://localhost:5173

2. Database GUI (Adminer)

Open a new browser tab and go to: http://localhost:8081

3. Backend Service

Can be accessed with check logs and make custom requests using postman at http://localhost:8080

Use the following credentials to log in:

System: PostgreSQL

Server: patient-db

Username: admin

Password: password

Database: patient_service

## How to Stop the Application
To stop all the running services, go to your terminal window where the application is running and press Ctrl + C.
